<H1> Personalized Healthcare System </H1>

The Personalized Healthcare System is an IoT and ML-based project designed for home use. It allows users to monitor their health, identify common illnesses based on symptoms, and predict potential COVID-19 infection. The system is developed using sensors, an Arduino Uno board, and programming languages like Python, R, and JavaScript.

<H2>Features</H2>
<H3>Health Monitoring</H3> Users can track their health and receive insights into potential health concerns.
<H3>Symptom Checker</H3> The system provides a symptom checker that suggests common illnesses based on entered symptoms.
<H3>COVID-19 Prediction</H3> Users can receive predictions on the likelihood of having contracted the COVID-19 virus.
<H3>Room Conditions</H3> The system measures temperature and humidity, notifying users of conditions that may impact virus transmission.
